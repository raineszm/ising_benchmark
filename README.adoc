This repo provides Monte Carlo simulation code for the 2D Ising model in several different languages.
The idea is to get a sense of suitability of each language numerical work.
Generally, I've attempted to use an equivalent implementation in each language, to the extent that it is idiomatic to do so.

== Usage

Needless to say each langauge must be installed before its implementation can be run.

I use the following to install each language and/or manage its tools and builds

C++::
    cmake and ninja

Julia::
    juliaup

Rust::
    rustup and cargo

Python::
    pyenv and poetry

To install the other tools needed to run the benchmarks you can use Homebrew (if on mac)

[source,bash]
----
brew bundle install
----


To run the benchmark, each language provides a https://taskfile.dev[Taskfile], which can be used to run the benchark from within that folder

[source,sh]
----
task benchmark
----

The benchmarks can also be run from the top level by prefixing with the language name

[source,sh]
----
task rust:benchmark
----

Run ``task -l`` to se a list of available benchmarks.

== Methods

The general algorithm used by each implementation is the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolff_algorithm[Wolff algorithm] which gneralizes thhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolisâ€“Hastings_algorithm[Metropolis-Hastings algorithm] to operate on clusters of spins.

Several worker threads are spawned, each of which instantiates a lattice.
Whenever a worker finishes a simulations it looks for a new temperature to simulate, reusing the same lattice.
In this sense the code models slowly warming the sample.

Benchmarking is done with ``hyperfine``.
